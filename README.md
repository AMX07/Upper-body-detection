# Upper Body Detection - README

This repository contains the implementation of an upper body detection algorithm using the Haar Cascade Classifier in OpenCV. The primary purpose of this project is to detect the upper body of a person in images or real-time video streams, such as webcams or CCTV footage.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

1. Python 3.x
2. OpenCV (cv2) - Version 4.x
3. NumPy

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
